# yt-react-db web browser extension

this is code repository for yt-react-db web browser extension.
Mainly tested on the "brave" web browser (which should be same behavior as google chrome).

pre-alpha

## Firefox

Ok, Firefox doesn't really fully implement manifest v3, so we need to replace the
content of manifest.json by manifest-firefox.json
